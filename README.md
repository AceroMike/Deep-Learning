Deep Learning

In this repository you will find some of the work I have done while learning Deep Learning. I try to get Deep into the material but start out with simple examples of **Artificial Neural Networks**. I will be using the **Tensorflow** and **Keras** libraries. These libraries are very useful for Deep Learning.
